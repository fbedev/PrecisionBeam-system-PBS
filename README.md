## 🧠 What is It?

**PrecisionBeam** is a simple but highly precise **mechanical homing principle** for rotating parts.  
It uses a **laser beam** and a **precisely placed hole** in a rotating body to allow light to pass through only at a specific angular alignment. A **photodiode** placed on the other side detects this moment, serving as an exact homing reference.

---

## 💡 Why It Matters

This method offers:
- 🔹 Contactless homing
- 🔹 No encoder or complex sensing required
- 🔹 Sub-degree alignment accuracy (depending on beam size and hole length)
- 🔹 Extremely low cost and mechanically simple
- 🔹 Works with basic electronics (5V laser and photodiode)

## ⚙️ Intended Use Cases

- Rotary table zero detection
- Gimbal or sensor calibration
- DIY robotics and CNC systems
- Precision indexing without encoders

This is a **foundational mechanical concept**, not a full hardware/software project. Others are free to build on it with credit.
